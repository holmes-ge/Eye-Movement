# Eye-Movement
This project creates a web page with two eyes that follow your mouse movement. 
Using HTML and CSS, the image of two eyes over a dark blue background appears on the browser. 
Javascript uses mouse detection to make it appear that both of the eyes are following the user's movements.
When running the program, move your mouse in different directions and watch the eyes follow the movement.
